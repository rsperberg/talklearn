I heard about a specific app that I knew was done in Appcelerator. So I began this project to see if I could reconstruct the app from scratch.

Initially I used graphics from the existing app, but I then deracinated the project, replacing the content with a made-up marketplace for learning and using foreign languages.

For navigation, the initial app used tabs, master-detail, click-to-open-new-window and a left-hand drawer. I began with a TabGroup but using that doesnâ€™t play nicely with master detail. 

The next step is to start over and use a pseudo tab group and rely on the other mechanisms for native navigation.
